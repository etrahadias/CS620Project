        "In March of 2020, the world temporarily shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of time was spent at home, businesses closed, holidays were celebrated via Zoom, and students and employees learned to work from home. Another major factor of life that was impacted by the pandemic was travel.\n",

        "I am looking to explore how travel trends have evolved over 2019, 2020, and 2021. I am curious to see if there is a relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases, the popularity of certain travel destinations, and the number of airline passengers. The **end goal** of the project is to visualize travel trends with COVID-19 statistics and to create a model that determines the relationship between airline passengers and number of COVID-19 cases.\n"

        "There are multiple data sets needed to investigate the above objectives. The first 3 data sets are from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?QO_VQ=EEE&QO_anzr=Nv4%FDPn44vr4%FDf6n6v56vp5%FD%FLS14z%FDHE%FDg4nssvp%FM-%FDNyy%FDPn44vr45&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%FDPn44vr45). I am using data from the T-100 Market (All Carriers) section. Air carriers report monthly air traffic information using the Form T-100, and it is entered into the Air Carrier Statistics database. The data sets display information like the number of airline passengers, the departures and destinations for flights entering into and departing from the U.S., and the month. Since each csv file represents a year (2019, 2020, & 2021), I will need to combine the 3 data sets into one for ease of analysis. A description of the variables in this data set can be found [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/TableInfo.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FMF&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45&V0s1_b0yB=D).\n",

It appears the data was entered or submitted by users, and there are a lot of missing values. This data set contains information about the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths by day per state in the United States. I will be using data from the [Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/research/evaluation-estimates/2020-evaluation-estimates/2010s-state-total.html) to obtain an approximate numbers for the population per state in order to normalize the COVID-19 data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the airplane flight data is broken down by month and the CDC data is broken down by day, I will have to clean the CDC data, organize it by month, and merge it with a modified version of the airline data to show the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of people traveling per month.\n",

        "*TBD - I may try to incorporate the data below to explore COVID-19's impact on airline profitability. Possible data source for airline profitability can be found [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements_Financial.aspx?Qn6n=K).*"

Some of the visualizations I'd like to include will explore the popular airlines and destinations prior to and during the height of the pandemic and the relationship between COVID-19 cases and airline travel. In addition, I want to make a linear regression model. The last step will be to create the final report and video."
