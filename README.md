CS 620 Project

In March of 2020, the world temporarily shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of time was spent at home, businesses closed, holidays were celebrated via Zoom, and students and employees learned to work from home. Another major factor of life that was impacted by the pandemic was travel.

I am looking to explore how travel trends have evolved over 2019 and 2020. How has COVID-19 impacted the travel industry? I am curious to see if there is a relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases, the popularity of certain travel destinations, and the number of airline passengers. The end goal of the project is to visualize travel trends with COVID-19 statistics and to attempt to create a model that determines the relationship between airline passengers and number of COVID-19 cases.

Goals
The objectives of this project are to:

* Merge and clean multiple data sets
* Perform exploratory data analysis
* Practice data wrangling
* Analyze U.S. travel trends in 2019 versus travel trends during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. most popular airlines, common destinations and travel months, number of people traveling, total number of flights, the number of international flights, etc.)
* Determine if there is a relationship between number of positive U.S. COVID-19 cases vs number of people traveling on airplanes
* Create interactive visualizations that display popular U.S. travel destinations and airlines before and during the pandemic
* Create visualizations that show COVID-19 trends in the U.S.
